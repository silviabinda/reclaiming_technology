# Reclaiming Technology
## A Collaborative Feminist Approach

Reclaiming Technology is a practice-based artistic research project initiated in 2024 by Silvia Binda Heiserova within the EU Digital Deal Artist Residency in collaboration with Ars Electronica and Pro Progressione.

The main goal of this project is to rethink the predominant androcentric narratives created and perpetuated around technologies. 
The premise is that technology is not neutral. It is a social artefact and therefore needs to be constantly questioned, retought and retooled.

As of October 2024, in its current stage, the project is concepted along 4 main strands: 
 STRAND 1: Research and Writing (essay writing as a practice for exploration, poetic and creative coding)
 STRAND 2: Reclaiming Technology Sessions (meetings, debates, workshops, and talks which open a collaborative space for sharing and creating knowledge) 
 STRAND 3: Artwork Series (any medium like for example DIY artefacts, performative live coding lecture mostly around the feminist perspective on topics of Human Computer Relation and Time Mediation by Technologies)
 STRAND 4: Edited Book Publication
